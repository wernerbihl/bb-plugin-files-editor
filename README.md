# bb-plugin-files-editor

A VS Code-style file explorer and editor for the workspace behind a bb thread,
laid out the way an editor is: a searchable file tree on the left, editor tabs
across the top, and the whole file in the middle — syntax highlighted, with
find in file, and editable.

_An illustration of the layout, not a screenshot — drawn from `docs/preview.html`
with invented project data, so no real repository or thread titles appear in it._

## What it gives you

- **A Files page** in the sidebar (`/plugins/files-editor/files`) with a
  workspace picker covering every project checkout and every thread worktree.
- **A Files tab beside a thread** — right panel → new tab → _Project files_.
  Pinned to that thread's workspace, so it shows the files the agent in that
  conversation is editing.
- **Two searches.** At the top of the tree, type to prune it to matching paths
  with every directory above them opened; <kbd>⌘P</kbd> opens the ranked
  go-to-file palette instead. Inside a file, the magnifier in the toolbar (or
  <kbd>⌘F</kbd>) finds text: match count, <kbd>Enter</kbd> / <kbd>⇧Enter</kbd>
  to step, `Aa` for case, and the hit is revealed whether you are reading or
  editing.
- **Project, then workspace.** Two dependent pickers — choose the project, then
  its checkout or one of its worktrees by branch name. Picking a project lands
  on its checkout.
- **Click a file and it opens in full** — its own tab, the complete contents,
  syntax-highlighted by BB's own source renderer, in your BB code theme.
- **Edit and save.** A Read / Edit toggle switches the pane to an editor;
  <kbd>⌘S</kbd> writes. Saves are guarded by the hash the file had when you
  opened it, so if an agent edited it underneath you the save stops and offers
  _Reload_ or _Overwrite_ rather than clobbering the change.
- **Images render**, other binaries say so instead of dumping bytes.
- **`bb files`** gives an agent the same listing from the CLI.

## Dotfiles

BB's own recursive listing drops every name starting with `.`, which is why
`.github`, `.env.example`, and `.gitignore` are missing from other file trees in
the app. For a workspace on the machine BB's server runs on, this plugin walks
the directory itself and shows them; the eye toggle in the explorer turns them
off.

A workspace on a _connected_ machine has to go through BB's listing, so dotfiles
are not available there and the toggle is hidden. The explorer says which mode
it is in.

## The CLI

```
bb files root                 # where the workspace is, and on which machine
bb files tree [--depth n] [--all] [--limit n]
bb files find <query> [--limit n]
bb files read <path>
```

Everything resolves against the thread the command runs in: its worktree when it
has one, otherwise the project's default checkout. It reads through BB, so it
returns the right bytes even when that workspace lives on another machine —
which is exactly when `ls` and `cat` would quietly read the wrong disk.

## Settings

**Excluded directories** — one name per line, matched against any path segment.
Defaults to `.git`, `node_modules`, and `vendor` — the three dependency trees
big enough to truncate a listing on their own. Remove one to browse it, or add
`dist`, `.venv`, `target`. Applies to the tree, the palette, and the CLI.

## Install

```sh
bb plugin install git:https://github.com/wernerbihl/bb-plugin-files-editor.git@^0.1.2
```

That tracks the 0.x line, so `bb plugin outdated` and `bb plugin update` pick up
later releases. To work on it locally instead, clone it and install the path:

```sh
bb plugin install /path/to/bb-plugin-files-editor
```

## Development

```sh
npm install --include=dev
npm test                              # pure logic: trees, ranking, find, paths
npm run typecheck
bb plugin dev                         # rebuild + reload on save
```

`lib/` holds the logic worth testing on its own — tree assembly, the fuzzy
ranker, in-file search, workspace grouping, workspace-relative path resolution,
route encoding. `server.ts` is mostly wiring; the components are the view.

## Limits

- The local walk stops at 40,000 entries and BB's remote listing at 10,000, and
  the explorer mounts at most 600 rows at a time. The footer says when either
  limit is in play; widening _Excluded directories_ is the fix for a truncated
  listing.
- Every `bb files` command is capped by BB's 1 MB limit on a command's output.
  Past that it prints what fits — whole lines, for a listing — and says how much
  it cut. BB discards an oversize result rather than truncating it, so the
  clipping is the difference between a partial answer and none.
- The editor is a textarea with a gutter, not a code editor: no completion and
  no multiple cursors, and find is literal text — no regex, no replace. For
  those, BB's builtin **File Editor** (Monaco) plugin claims the file-preview
  surface; the ↗ button in the toolbar hands it the current file.
- Reading, a find hit highlights its whole line, because line ranges are what
  BB's source viewer accepts. Editing selects the exact match.
- Files over 4 MB open read-only.
- The tree does not create, rename, or delete files.
